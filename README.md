# SenateData: A Functional Tool for the SenateData Dataset

SenateData is a package designed to allow a user with only basic knowledge of R interact with CongressData, a dataset with over 900 variables that compiles information about all US Senators and state-years across 1789-2024, and its codebook. The dataset tracks state characteristics, Senators, and the behavior of those Senators in policymaking. Users can find variables related to state- and member-level demographics, politics, and policy; subset the data across multiple dimensions; create custom aggregations of the dataset; and access citations in both plain text and BibTeX for every variable.
